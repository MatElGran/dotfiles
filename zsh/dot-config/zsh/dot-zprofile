# This file is sourced only for login shells, and is read before .zshrc. and most 
# importantly before /etc/zshrc
# (See ~/.zshenv for the complete sourcing order)
#
# This early sourcing is necessary to disable macOS Terminal.app session management 
# before /etc/zshrc runs.
#
# Terminal.app's "Save/Restore Shell State" feature saves session data to ~/.zsh-sessions.
# While I rarely use Terminal.app, I sometimes have to, so I disable this to prevent it
# from polluting the home directory and avoid conflicts with .zshrc history settings.

# Brew installation script set the hook here, while documentation talks about adding it
# to the .zshrc file. This sets up a few environments variables which the rest of the 
# configuration relies on, so we're running it as early as possible.
